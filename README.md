# Tiles_Ex7
In this homework i took the original game from Erel github and change it to make it a result for the tasks.

For task D:
I added a diamond tile to the tile pallete.
I took the scene: 4-generation -> d-tilemap-100-player and changed the code of Scripts->4-generation->TilemapCaveGenerator.
If the tile that chosen is a floor i draw a number between 0-100 and if its under 2 the selected tile will be a Diamond tile.
