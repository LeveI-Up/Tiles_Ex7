# Tiles_Ex7
In this homework i took the original game from Erel github and change it to make it a result for the tasks.

For task F: [here](https://github.com/LeveI-Up/Tiles_Ex7/blob/main/%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%94%207.pdf)

This is a part of week 7 weekly task.
In this game i added 3 levels - in each level: the size of the map is bigger & the number of enemies is increasing.
The player need to reach to the gate in order to get to the next level.
### Changes:
  * Added 3 levels
  * The size of the grid getting bigger & the number of enemies is increasing
  * Added gate with a Collider in order to rich the next level
  * 2 functions for calculating the distance & position between the nearest and farthest floors, so the player and the gate can be initialized on both sides of the map [here](https://github.com/LeveI-Up/Tiles_Ex7/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/4-generation/TilemapCaveGenerator.cs)
  * Added GateToNextLevel script in order to load the next level [here](https://github.com/LeveI-Up/Tiles_Ex7/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/4-generation/GateToNextLevel.cs)
